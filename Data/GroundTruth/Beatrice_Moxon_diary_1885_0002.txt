for "Dames Seules" on the train I had to get into
at ordinary plcl: At each station I feared less
I should be intruded upon, but as far as Town
I travelled happily <u>alone</u>. At Lournai the train 
Stopped for about 10 minutes when guard came
Into my carriage to ask me where I was bound
For + if I had anything to declare. I said no
But he stood there as if waiting for me to open
My box, I got my keys out but he was mifalie
+ went off, however I opened my box expecting
Would return, he did not come so I lock it aga
I was just settled down again when a French
Geullemand(?)[UNCLEAR] came into the carriage. I gelt an innvar[UNCLEAR]
shock but smothered it + <del>lost</del> held my head up
As if I had been <u>Princess</u> Beatrice! At last the
train started; I had a mingled feeling of joy
sorrow + fear!!! Well, just now my companion
(who was everything but what I should have preferred
a thorough Frenchman) began to question me as to
where I was going, + if I travelled "alone"?
I said yes + he noticed I was not a country-
woman of his! He asked me several
other questions about Lille, Busselles, Englan
School, the mistresses, + last of all which
