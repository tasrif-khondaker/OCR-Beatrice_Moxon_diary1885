fun of it - In the morning they went to see
the forevent for Mille M. - a slight row
about Acteney to go to bed before the nine;
Ethel not at all well.
Thursday 19. Splendid day believe it has been
freezing during the night: heard the recital
of the Piece ‘I think it will be a failure.’
Friday 20. Mille P. asked in all to play
a Piece to morrow. Fearful confusion! All
girls took, turned out! Went to bed early
Saturday 21. Mille Marie pile. came down
to the breakfast at 9. Had the usual fun
& Ceremony at 11-30. In the little class
Mr Lemmens read the letter J. Campbell wrote
to him. In the 2nd G. Dale wrote it & G. Hale
read it. Every body couldn’t courtesy at all
Julia made a little speech for the first class
Mille M liked the bureau very much.
She had 10 bouquets & 2 plats. Walen
sent her a lovely Venetian glass bowl-
with flowers made of beads - In the after
the little girls played a short piece
called "Le Portail de Grandeurière". They
did it splendidly - Then came in a cottee
at which I was obliged to assist - played Bohemen.
