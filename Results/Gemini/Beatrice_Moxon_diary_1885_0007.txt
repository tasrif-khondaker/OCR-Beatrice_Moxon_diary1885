Friday. 23. Lessons The Same. The Dales got home
from home to say they were to return about the
10th of March. Awfully Sorry.-- Did not go out
Saturday. 24. Went to Gymnasium & enjoyed it
much. Boys went back to School Yesterday.
Sunday. 25. Went to Church. In the afternoon Millie
Maxie asked us to go to the Wood but we did not
want to go asked her to excuse us: an awful,
row ensued, & we didn't go. Awfully homesick
& miserable, so tired of being here!.
Monday. 26. Lessons as usual. In the evening got a
letter from home. They seem very dull without
the dear old boys.-- Papa has mentioned Easter
hope they will come.-- Wish the time would pass
. Quicker.
Tuesday. 27. Lessons as usual. Went to Gymnasium
My fingers one on each hand have a good deal
But afraid they are going to Gather.--
Wednesday. 28 Everything the same. All the
Snow gone because of the rain. The Girls
found! Mille P.S. broke!. Talking already about
Home. Only one week before Bertie goes.--
My fingers more painful!: holo miserably to
have all this bother & pain away from home.--
