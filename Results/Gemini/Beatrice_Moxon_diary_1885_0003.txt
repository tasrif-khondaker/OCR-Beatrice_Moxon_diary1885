I had to look Soul-a-Sail unconcerned.
But to cut a long story short, at the
next station he saw that I was put into a
Carriage for Ladies only. I travelled alone
until I got to Bruxelles; where Mdle Pauline,
I. Dale, I. Ayr, P. Lilly & E. Snowball, & Mr. Dale
met me, I was very very Glad to see them all once
more. We walked up from the Station, & on arriving
at 2 Rue aux Lames, after the usual Greetings
