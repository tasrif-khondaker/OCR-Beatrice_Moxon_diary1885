Monday 9. Nothing out of the Common line
Gerlad began to pack her box.
Tuesday 10. Had my last dance with
Gerhad how horrid. Came home with Mell I.
before the others with G. Ayre, G. D. & M. Dale
All back into town, & had a delicious
Piece of Paste : We all had to say the
English Sent, to the Wood with Mell P.
It was splendid. We walked there & took
the train back; & found the first daisy
of 1885. Which she gave me. This piece of
Ivy etc to be kept as a memoriam
of my dearest friend, & the last night
I spent with her at school. –
Some of the girls danced in the
evening, but I could not.
Very Sad in mr. Arlour, & I shall
never forget U. I. Slept with me on
Wednesday 11. At last the
day had come when the Dales
& so much to our sorrow. & So
after all the good-byes had
been said & the tears shed.
