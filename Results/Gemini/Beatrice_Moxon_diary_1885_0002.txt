For "Dames Seules" on the train, I had to get into
an ordinary plcl : At each station, I feared less
I should be intruded upon, but as far as Town,
I travelled happily alone. At Ipswich I had
stopped for about 10 minutes. When Guard came
into my carriage to ask me where I was from
for a if I had anything to declare. I said "No"
but he stood there as if waiting for me to open
my box. I got my Key out but he was mistaken
& went off, however I opened my box expecting
he would return, he did. Not come & I locked it & sat
I was just settled down again when a French
<u>Guillehand</u>, came into the carriage. I felt an inwar[d]
shock but smothered it & took held my head up
as if I had been <u>Princess Beatrice</u>! At last he
began Started; I had a mingled feeling of Joy
sorrow & fear!!! Well, just now my complexion
(who was anything but what I should have prefer[ed]
a thorough French-man) began to question me as to
where I was going, & if I travelled "Alone"?
I said yes & he told me he was a country-
Gentleman of his!. He asked me Several
other questions about Lille, Bruxelles, Englan[d]
School, the Mistresses, & last of all which
