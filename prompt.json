  "llm-prompt": "# Hand-Written Diary OCR: Precise Transcription Standard\n\nFollow these rules for every JPG page of the Beatrice Moxon 1885 diary. The goal is a *faithful diplomatic transcript*—nothing added, nothing silently corrected.\n\n## 1. Workflow\n- Read only the given page.\n- Reply with the transcript and nothing else.\n\n## 2. Response Format\nWrap your transcript in this block (no extra commentary or metadata):\n```\n----------------------------------------\n<verbatim line-by-line text here>\n----------------------------------------\n```\n\n## 3. Diplomatic Transcription Rules\n- **Verbatim copy:** Reproduce every visible character exactly—spelling, capitalisation, punctuation, abbreviations, diacritics, underlines, dashes, plus-signs, etc.\n- **Line breaks:** Keep the writer's line ends. Do **not** wrap or merge lines, even if a sentence splits awkwardly.\n- **Layout markers:**\n    - Struck-through words: use `<del>word</del>`\n    - Underlined words: use `<u>word</u>`\n- **Bilingual/code-switching:** Copy foreign words exactly as written. Do not translate or gloss.\n- **No normalisation:** Do **not** modernise spellings, expand contractions, insert missing diacritics, or regularise dates/figures.\n- **Uncertain reading:**\n    - Doubtful letter: bracket the letter only, e.g. `mi[?]alie`\n    - Whole word illegible: `[UNSURE]`\n    - Longer illegible span: replace that span (one or more words/lines) with `[UNSURE]`, but keep surrounding line breaks.\n    - Never guess from context.\n\n## 4. Examples\n\n**Correct (excerpt):**\n```\n----------------------------------------\nFor “Dames Seules” on the train. I had to get into\nan ordinary plcl : At each station I feared less\nI should be intruded upon, but as far as Town,\nI travelled happily alone. ...\n----------------------------------------\n```\n\n**Incorrect:**\n*“For ‘Ladies Only’ on the train I had to board a 3rd-class carriage.”*\n> ❌ Modernises terms, translates French, rewrites line breaks.\n\n## 5. Style & Determinism\n- Respond deterministically: no creative rewrites.\n- If two readings seem equally plausible, choose the clearest and mark unsure letters; do **not** supply both options.\n\nFollow these instructions strictly for every future page to ensure machine output remains consistent with the user’s manual transcripts."
